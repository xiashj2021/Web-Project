宣纸上走笔至此搁一半

釉色渲染仕女图韵味被私藏

而你嫣然的一笑如含苞待放

你的美一缕飘散

色白花青的锦鲤跃然于碗底

临摹宋体落款时却惦记着你

你隐藏在窑烧里千年的秘密

极细腻犹如绣花针落地

帘外芭蕉惹骤雨门环惹铜绿

而我路过那江南小镇惹了你

在泼墨山水画里

你从墨色深处被隐去

原来全是你

令我的思忆漫长

何年何月

才又可今宵一样

让眼睛讲彼此立场

当风声吹乱你构想

可否抽空想这张旧模样

Keep it between friends

Though I know you''ll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us

And colour you in

If things go right we can frame it

And put you on a wall

And it''s so hard to say it

But I''ve been here before

Now I''ll surrender up my heart

And swap it for yours

And out of all these things I''ve done

I think I love you better now

Don''t hold me down

I think the braces are breaking

And it''s more than I can take

And it''s dark in a cold December

But I''ve got you to keep me warm

If you''re broken I''ll mend ya

And keep you sheltered from the storm that''s raging on now

I''m out of touch I''m out of love

I''ll pick you up when you''re getting down

And out of all these things I''ve done

I think I love you better now

I''m out of sight I''m out of mind

I''ll do it all for you in time

And out of all these things I''ve done

The club isn''t the best place to find a lover

So the bar is where I go

Me and my friends at the table doing shots

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

You come over and start up a conversation with just me

And trust me I''ll give it a chance now

Take my hand stop put Van the Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance and now I''m singing like

Girl you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now follow my lead

I may be crazy don''t mind me

Say boy let''s not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now follow my lead

Come come on now follow my lead

I''m in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I''m in love with your body

Last night you were in my room

And now my bed sheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I''m in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I

I''m in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I

I''m in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I

I''m in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I''m in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin

We''re going out on our first date

You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doing okay

Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play and I''m singing like

Girl you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now follow my lead

I may be crazy don''t mind me

Say boy let''s not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now follow my lead

Come come on now follow my lead

I''m in love with the shape of you

I found a love for me

Darling just dive right in and follow my lead

Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet

Oh I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time

But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own

And in your eyes you''re holding mine

Baby I''m dancing in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song

When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath

But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know

She shares my dreams I hope that someday I''ll share her home

I found a love to carry more than just my secrets

To carry love to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we''re so in love fighting against all odds

I know we''ll be alright this time

Darling just hold my hand be my girl I''ll be your man

I see my future in your eyes

Baby I''m dancing in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song

When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful

I don''t deserve this darling you look perfect tonight

Baby I''m dancing in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song

I have faith in what I see

Now I know I have met an angel in person

And she looks perfect I don''t deserve this

You look perfect tonight'),

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

But she fell in love with an English man

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Said baby I just wanna dance

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar

She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm

Said it was one of my friend''s songs do you want to drink on

She took Jamie as a chaser Jack for the fun

She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as shot gun

Chatted some more one more drink at the bar

Then put Van on the jukebox got up to dance you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

But she fell in love with an English man

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Said baby I just wanna dance

With my pretty little Galway Girl

You''re my pretty little Galway Girl

Hey

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool

And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room

As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool

After dancing the Ceili singing to trad tunes

I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet

Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat

Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week

And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know she played the fiddle in an Irish band

But she fell in love with an English man

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Said baby I just wanna dance

My pretty little Galway girl

My my my my my my my Galway girl

My my my my my my my Galway girl

My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we''ve outstayed our welcome and it''s closing time

I was holding her hand her hand was holding mine

Our coats both smell of smoke whisky and wine

As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside

Finished some Doritos and another bottle of wine

I swear I''m gonna put you in a song that I write

About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

But she fell in love with an English man

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Said baby I just wanna dance

Chemistry ''til it blows up ''til there''s no us

It''s on your face

Just want to lift you up and not let you go

Tells me this love is worth the fight oh

Punished you with silence

Went off like sirens just crying

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati

Down a dead-end street

Faster than the wind passionate as sin

Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind

Once you''re already flying through the free fall

Like the colors in autumn so bright

Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I''d never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

But loving him was red

Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted

Was right there in front of you

Memorizing him was as easy as knowing

All the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword

And realizing there''s no right answer

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out

That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I''d never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

But loving him was red

Oh red

Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it''s time now gotta let go

But moving on from him is impossible

When I still see it all in my head

In burning red

Loving him was red

Oh losing him was blue like I''d never known

Missing him was dark grey all alone

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

''Cause loving him was red

No choice but to

Stay stay stay

I''d spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more

Oh if that''s what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours

And I might never get there but I''m gonna try

If it''s ten thousand hours or the rest of my life

I''m gonna love you

Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

I''m gonna love you

Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

Ooh want the good and the bad and everything in between

Ooh gotta cure my curiosity

Ooh yeah

I''d spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more

Oh if that''s what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours

And I might never get there but I''m gonna try

If it''s ten thousand hours or the rest of my life

I''m gonna love you

Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

I''m gonna love you

Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

Yeah

词：许嵩

曲：许嵩

编曲：许嵩

窗透初晓 日照西桥 云自摇

想你当年荷风微摆的衣角

木雕流金 岁月涟漪 七年前封笔

因为我今生挥毫只为你

雨打湿了眼眶 年年倚井盼归堂

最怕不觉泪已拆两行

我在人间彷徨 寻不到你的天堂

东瓶西镜放 恨不能遗忘

又是清明雨上 折菊寄到你身旁

把你最爱的歌来轻轻唱

远方有琴 愀然空灵 声声催天雨

涓涓心事说给自己听

月影憧憧 烟火几重 烛花红

红尘旧梦 梦断都成空

雨打湿了眼眶 年年倚井盼归堂

最怕不觉泪已拆两行

我在人间彷徨 寻不到你的天堂

东瓶西镜放 恨不能遗忘

又是清明雨上 折菊寄到你身旁

把你最爱的歌来轻轻唱

我在人间彷徨 寻不到你的天堂

东瓶西镜放 恨不能遗忘

又是清明雨上 折菊寄到你身旁

把你最爱的歌来轻轻唱'),

为什么 你当时对我好

又为什么 现在变得冷淡了

我知道 爱要走难阻挠

反正不是我的 我也不该要

你和我 曾经有共同爱好

谁的耳边 总有绝句在萦绕

我们俩 用文言文对话真的很搞笑

还笑那曹操贪慕着小乔

天灰了 雨坠了

视线要模糊了

此时感觉到你的重要

爱走了 心走了

你说你要走了

我为你唱最后的古谣

红雨瓢泼泛起了回忆怎么潜

你美目如当年 流转我心间

渡口边最后一面洒下了句点

与你若只如初见

何须感伤离别

你和我 曾经有共同爱好

谁的耳边 总有绝句在萦绕

我们俩 用文言文对话真的很搞笑

还笑那曹操贪慕着小乔

天灰了 雨坠了

视线要模糊了

爱走了 心走了

如果有一天

我回到从前

回到最原始的我

你是否会觉得我不错

如果有一天

我离你遥远

不能再和你相约

你是否会发觉我已经说再见

当你的眼睛眯着笑

当你喝可乐当你吵

我想对你好

你从来不知道

想你想你

也能成为嗜好

当你说今天的烦恼

当你说夜深你睡不着

我想对你说

却害怕都说错

好喜欢你

知不知道

如果有一天

梦想都实现

回忆都成了永远

你是否还会记得今天

如果有一天

我们都发觉

原来什么都可以

我们是否还会停留在这里

当你的眼睛眯着笑

当你喝可乐当你吵

我想对你好

你从来不知道

想你想你

也能成为嗜好

当你说今天的烦恼

当你说夜深你睡不着

我想对你说

却害怕都说错

好喜欢你

知不知道

也许空虚让我想得太多

也许该回到被窝

梦里会相遇

就毫不犹豫

大声的说我要说

当你的眼睛眯着笑

当你喝可乐当你吵

我想对你好

你从来不知道

想你想你

也能成为嗜好

当你说今天的烦恼

当你说夜深你睡不着

我想对你说

却害怕都说错

好喜欢你知不知道

当你的眼睛眯着笑

当你喝可乐当你吵

我想对你好

你从来不知道

想你想你也能成为嗜好

他静悄悄地来过

他慢慢带走沉默

只是最后的承诺

还是没有带走了寂寞

我们爱的没有错

只是美丽的独秀

太折磨

她说无所谓

只要能在夜里

翻来覆去的时候有寄托

等不到天黑

烟火不会太完美

回忆烧成灰

还是等不到结尾

她曾说的无所谓

我怕一天一天被摧毁

等不到天黑

不敢凋谢的花蕾

绿叶在跟随

放开刺痛的滋味

今后不再怕天明

我想只是害怕清醒

他静悄悄地来过

他慢慢带走沉默

只是最后的承诺

还是没有带走了寂寞

我们爱的没有错

一个人眺望碧海和蓝天

在心里面 那抹灰就淡一些

海豚从眼前飞越

我看见了最阳光的笑脸

好时光都该被宝贝

因为有限

我学着不去担心得太远

不计划太多反而能勇敢冒险

丰富地过每一天

快乐地看每一天

遮住你侧脸

有什么故事好想了解

我感觉我懂你的特别

你的心有一道墙

但我发现一扇窗

偶尔透出一丝暖暖的微光

就算你有一道墙

我的爱会攀上窗台盛放

打开窗你会看到

悲伤融化

('S00033', 'Heal The World - Michael Jackson (迈克尔·杰克逊)

Lyrics by：Michael Jackson

Composed by：Michael Jackson/Marty Paich

Arranged by：Michael Jackson

There''s a place in your heart

And I know that it is love

And this place could be much

Brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try

You''ll find there''s no need to cry

In this place you''ll feel

There''s no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there

If you care enough for the living

Make a little space

Make a better place

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me

And the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place

For you and for me

If you want to know why

There''s a love that cannot lie

Love is strong

It only cares for joyful giving

If we try we shall see

In this bliss we cannot feel

Fear or dread

We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always

Love''s enough for us growing

So make a better world

To make a better world

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me

And the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in

Will reveal a joyful face

And the world we once believed in

Will shine again in grace

Then why do we keep strangling life

Wound this earth crucify its soul

Though it''s plain to see

This world is heavenly

Be god''s glow

We could fly so high

Let our spirits never die

In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

Create a world with no fear

Together we''ll cry happy tears

See the nations turn their swords into ploughshares

We could really get there

If you cared enough for the living

Make a little space

To make a better place

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me

And the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me

And the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world

Make it a better place

For you and for me

And the entire human race

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying

If you care enough for the living

Make a better place for you and for me

You and for me

You and for me

You and for me

You and for me

Hey Jude don''t make it bad

Take a sad song and make it better

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude don''t be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain hey Jude refrain

Don''t carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it''s a fool who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder

Na na na na na na na na na

Hey Jude don''t let me down

You have found her now go and get her

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in

Hey Jude begin

You''re waiting for someone to perform with

And don''t you know that it''s just you

Hey Jude you''ll do

The movement you need is on your shoulder

Na na na na na na na na na yeah

Hey Jude don''t make it bad

Take a sad song and make it better

Remember to let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better

Better better better better better
